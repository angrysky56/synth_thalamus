# Enhanced Workspace Implementation Notes

This document summarizes the implementation of the enhanced workspace with phase similarity attention, as outlined in the design discussions.

## Overview

The implementation follows "Option B: Phase Similarity Attention Bias" from the design documents. This approach computes pairwise phase similarity between gated tokens and uses that similarity to bias the attention mechanism, encouraging tokens with similar phase signatures to attend more strongly to each other.

## Key Features

1. **PhaseSimilarityTransformerLayer**
   - Custom transformer implementation that explicitly uses phase tags to bias attention
   - Computes cosine similarity between phase vectors to create an attention bias
   - Learnable `phase_scale` parameter to control the influence of phase similarity
   - Full implementation of multi-head attention with phase bias

2. **EnhancedWorkspace**
   - Multi-layer architecture with multiple phase-aware transformer layers
   - Separation of content and phase information for targeted processing
   - Layer normalization and feed-forward networks as in standard transformers
   - Storage of attention weights for visualization and analysis

3. **Phase Similarity Demo**
   - Visualization of standard vs. enhanced attention patterns
   - Demonstration of how phase tags influence attention weights
   - Comparison of models with and without phase similarity bias

4. **Integration with Training**
   - Command-line option to switch between standard and enhanced workspace
   - Backward compatibility with existing code
   - Minimal changes required to use the enhanced workspace

## Biological Inspiration

The implementation is inspired by neural oscillations in the thalamus that coordinate cortical processing. The phase tags function as a kind of temporal signature that can:

- **Temporal Binding**: Help determine which tokens should be processed together
- **Rhythmic Synchronization**: Act as a "clock" signal for aligning information streams
- **Feature Grouping**: Guide the workspace to emphasize tokens with similar phases

## Testing

The implementation includes tests that verify:

1. **Shape Compatibility**: Ensuring the PhaseSimilarityTransformerLayer maintains the expected output shapes
2. **Phase Bias Effect**: Testing that tokens with similar phase vectors attend more strongly to each other
3. **End-to-End Integration**: Verifying that the EnhancedWorkspace works correctly in the full model

## Future Directions

Potential enhancements for future work:

1. **Adaptive Phase Scale**: Making the phase scale parameter task-dependent or input-dependent
2. **Alternative Similarity Metrics**: Exploring different ways to compute phase similarity
3. **Feedback Integration**: Developing a feedback loop from the workspace back to the thalamus
4. **Multiple Attention Modes**: Implementing different modes of attention based on phase relationships
5. **Phase Analysis**: Tools for analyzing how phase patterns emerge during training
