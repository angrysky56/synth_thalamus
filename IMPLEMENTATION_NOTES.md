# Implementation Notes

This document summarizes the implementation details of the Synthetic Thalamus project, including both the enhanced workspace with phase similarity attention and the enhanced semantic phase generator.

## 1. Enhanced Workspace with Phase Similarity Attention

### Overview

The enhanced workspace implementation follows "Option B: Phase Similarity Attention Bias" from the design documents. This approach computes pairwise phase similarity between gated tokens and uses that similarity to bias the attention mechanism, encouraging tokens with similar phase signatures to attend more strongly to each other.

### Key Features

1. **PhaseSimilarityTransformerLayer**
   - Custom transformer implementation that explicitly uses phase tags to bias attention
   - Computes cosine similarity between phase vectors to create an attention bias
   - Learnable `phase_scale` parameter to control the influence of phase similarity
   - Full implementation of multi-head attention with phase bias

2. **EnhancedWorkspace**
   - Multi-layer architecture with multiple phase-aware transformer layers
   - Separation of content and phase information for targeted processing
   - Layer normalization and feed-forward networks as in standard transformers
   - Storage of attention weights for visualization and analysis
   - Support for different activation functions (GELU, ReLU)

3. **Phase Similarity Demo**
   - Visualization of standard vs. enhanced attention patterns
   - Demonstration of how phase tags influence attention weights
   - Comparison of models with and without phase similarity bias

4. **Integration with Training**
   - Command-line option to switch between standard and enhanced workspace
   - Backward compatibility with existing code
   - Minimal changes required to use the enhanced workspace

## 2. Enhanced Semantic Phase Generator

### Overview

The enhanced semantic phase generator significantly improves upon the original implementation by providing a more expressive and configurable architecture for generating phase vectors from semantic embeddings. This allows for finer control over phase patterns and better capture of semantic relationships.

### Key Features

1. **Configurable MLP Architecture**
   - Variable depth and width through the `hidden_dims` parameter
   - Support for networks of arbitrary depth
   - Layer normalization between layers for better gradient flow
   - Ability to create both simple and deep architectures

2. **Multiple Activation Functions**
   - GELU activation for smoother gradients
   - Leaky ReLU for preventing "dying neurons"
   - SiLU (Swish) for improved performance
   - PReLU for adaptive slope in negative region
   - Traditional ReLU as a baseline option

3. **Phase Diversity Parameter**
   - Learnable scaling factor for phase vector diversity
   - Controls the spread of phase values
   - Higher values encourage more distinct phase patterns
   - Can be tuned to balance specificity and generalization

4. **Contrastive Learning Component**
   - InfoNCE-style contrastive loss function
   - Encourages tokens with the same semantic category to have similar phases
   - Discourages tokens from different categories from having similar phases
   - Temperature parameter to control the sharpness of contrasts

5. **Phase Analysis Tools**
   - Computation of intra-category vs. inter-category similarities
   - Calculation of similarity matrices for visualization
   - Statistical measures of phase pattern diversity
   - Visualization functions for phase relationships

### Implementation Details

The `EnhancedSemanticPhaseGenerator` class replaces the original `SemanticPhaseGenerator` and provides:

1. **Initialization Options**
   ```python
   EnhancedSemanticPhaseGenerator(
       d_model,                # Input embedding dimension
       phase_dim,              # Output phase dimension
       hidden_dims=[128, 64],  # Hidden layer dimensions
       activation='gelu',      # Activation function type
       phase_diversity=2.0,    # Diversity scaling factor
       use_layer_norm=True     # Whether to use layer normalization
   )
   ```

2. **Forward Path Computation**
   - Multi-layer transformation of semantic embeddings
   - Scaling by the diversity parameter
   - Tanh activation to restrict output range to [-1, 1]

3. **Integration with SyntheticThalamus**
   - Seamless replacement of the original phase generator
   - Backward compatibility with existing code
   - Additional configuration options for flexibility

4. **Analysis Tools**
   - The `PhaseAnalyzer` class provides metrics and visualization methods
   - Functions to compute similarity matrices and category-based metrics
   - Tools to quantify the effectiveness of phase representations

## Biological Inspiration

Both components are inspired by neural oscillations in the thalamus that coordinate cortical processing. The phase tags function as a kind of temporal signature that can:

- **Temporal Binding**: Help determine which tokens should be processed together
- **Rhythmic Synchronization**: Act as a "clock" signal for aligning information streams
- **Feature Grouping**: Guide the workspace to emphasize tokens with similar phases

The enhanced semantic phase generator further improves this biological analogy by:

- **Semantic Grouping**: Similar semantic concepts produce similar phase patterns
- **Hierarchical Processing**: Multi-layer transformations capture complex relationships
- **Adaptive Diversity**: Learnable diversity parameter mimics biological tuning of oscillatory patterns

## Testing

The implementation includes tests that verify:

1. **Shape Compatibility**: Ensuring components maintain the expected output shapes
2. **Phase Bias Effect**: Testing that tokens with similar phase vectors attend more strongly to each other
3. **Activation Functions**: Verifying the behavior of different activation functions
4. **Diversity Parameter**: Measuring the impact of the diversity parameter on phase patterns
5. **Contrastive Learning**: Testing the contrastive loss for encouraging semantic similarity
6. **End-to-End Integration**: Verifying that all components work correctly together

## 3. Feedback Loop Implementation

### Overview

The feedback loop implementation creates a recurrent connection between the workspace and thalamus, enabling a more biologically plausible architecture that can refine its attention over multiple iterations.

### Key Components

1. **WorkspaceToThalamusFeedback**
   - Creates a direct channel from workspace outputs back to thalamus inputs
   - Uses attention to determine how feedback influences thalamus processing
   - Includes a gating mechanism to control feedback strength

2. **RecurrentThalamusWorkspace**
   - Manages the iterative processing between thalamus and workspace
   - Supports fixed or adaptive number of iterations
   - Tracks intermediate states for analysis and visualization

3. **HierarchicalThalamus**
   - Implements a stacked architecture with multiple thalamus layers
   - Each layer processes progressively more abstract features
   - Includes optional feedback connections between layers

4. **CrossModalFeedback**
   - Enables information sharing between different modalities
   - Creates a more integrated multi-modal processing system
   - Uses attention and gating to control cross-modal influence

### Implementation Details

The `WorkspaceToThalamusFeedback` module takes the state of the workspace and generates a feedback signal that modifies the inputs to the thalamus:

```python
class WorkspaceToThalamusFeedback(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, workspace_dim, thalamus_dim, feedback_dim=64, 
                 num_heads=4, dropout=0.1, use_gating=True):
        # Initialize feedback components
        # ...
    
    def forward(self, workspace_state, thalamus_inputs, return_attention=False):
        # Generate feedback signal
        feedback = self.workspace_projector(workspace_state)
        
        # Apply attention between feedback and thalamus inputs
        attn_output, attn_weights = self.attention(
            query=feedback, key=thalamus_inputs, value=thalamus_inputs)
        
        # Apply gated feedback
        modified_inputs = thalamus_inputs + gate * (attn_output - feedback_expanded)
        
        return modified_inputs
```

The `RecurrentThalamusWorkspace` manages the iterative processing between thalamus and workspace:

```python
class RecurrentThalamusWorkspace(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, thalamus, workspace, feedback, max_iterations=3,
                 adaptive_iterations=False, halt_threshold=0.05):
        # Initialize components
        # ...
    
    def forward(self, inputs, task_ids=None, return_intermediates=False):
        # Recurrent processing loop
        for i in range(self.max_iterations):
            # Apply feedback if we have workspace state
            if workspace_state is not None:
                inputs_modified = self.feedback(workspace_state, inputs)
            else:
                inputs_modified = inputs
            
            # Process through thalamus and workspace
            thalamus_output = self.thalamus(inputs_modified, task_ids)
            workspace_output, pooled = self.workspace(thalamus_output)
            
            # Update workspace state
            workspace_state = pooled
            
            # Check for early stopping if using adaptive iterations
            # ...
        
        return workspace_output, pooled
```

### Biological Inspiration

This implementation is closely aligned with the biological organization of thalamo-cortical circuits, which feature:

- **Reciprocal connections**: The biological thalamus both sends information to and receives feedback from the cortex
- **Iterative refinement**: Neural circuits engage in multiple cycles of processing
- **Modulatory feedback**: Cortical feedback modulates thalamic relay neurons
- **Hierarchical organization**: The biological thalamus has multiple nuclei at different levels of processing

### Practical Applications

The feedback loop implementation enables:

1. **Attention Refinement**: Multiple iterations allow the system to progressively focus on the most relevant tokens
2. **Information Integration**: Feedback helps integrate information across different parts of the input
3. **Dynamic Processing**: The number of iterations can adapt to task difficulty
4. **Cross-Modal Coordination**: Different modalities can influence each other's processing

## Future Directions

Potential enhancements for future work:

1. **Adaptive Phase Scale**: Making the phase scale parameter task-dependent or input-dependent
2. **Alternative Similarity Metrics**: Exploring different ways to compute phase similarity
3. **Multiple Attention Modes**: Implementing different modes of attention based on phase relationships
4. **Task-Adaptive Diversity**: Making the diversity parameter task-dependent
5. **Reinforcement Learning Integration**: Using rewards to shape phase patterns
